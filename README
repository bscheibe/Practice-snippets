Hello,

	This repository is a collection of small programs, each demonstrating individual concepts. I am writing these on an Ubuntu VM to familiarize myself with virtual machines, Git, and the linux OS itself.

	Everything will be in one place on this repo so that I do not have to keep track of multiple locations for my learning, and to provent catastrophe.

	The command line will be used for all possible operations. From creating and editing files, to managing Git repositories, to the coding itself, any work done will be with an effort to escape mouse and UI control.

	With such a large overlap of new topics to delve into, learning as I go will be easier because topics will be taught by need rather than suggestion. Let's have some fun!

Regards,
Scheibe
