Hello,

	This repository is a collection of small programs, each demonstrating individual concepts. I am writing all of them on Linux to familiarize myself with virtual machines, Git, and the UNIX command line.

	Everything will be in one place on this repo so that I do not have to keep track of multiple locations for my learning, and to provent catastrophe.

Regards,
Scheibe
